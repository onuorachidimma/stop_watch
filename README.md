# Day 8 - Stopwatch App

## Activity Overview

### Task:
- Build a functional stopwatch app using React JS to master state management, event handling, and lifecycle methods.

### Goals:
- **State Management:** Learn how to manage component state effectively in React.
- **Event Handling:** Handle user interactions, such as button clicks, to control the stopwatch.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Use React lifecycle methods to manage the timer interval and component mounting/unmounting.

### Steps:
1. **Set Up React Environment:** Initialize a React app using `create-react-app` or any preferred setup.
2. **Create `Stopwatch` Component:** Develop the core component to handle the stopwatch functionality.
3. **Build Features:**
   - Display the elapsed time in the format mm:ss.
   - Implement Start, Stop, and Reset buttons.
   - Manage state to handle the elapsed time.
   - Handle button click events to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
   - Use lifecycle methods to manage the timer interval when the component mounts and unmounts.
4. **Update Display:** Ensure the elapsed time updates every millisecond while the stopwatch is running.

## Technologies Used
- **React JS:** For building the stopwatch UI and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For basic styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For handling time updates and event management.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
